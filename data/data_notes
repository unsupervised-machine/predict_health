All data is numeric (floats and ints)

Row count, column count
    rows, 1177
    columns, 51
Considerable missing data for following columns:
    BMI, 215
    Lactic acid, 229
    PCO2, 294
    Notes: 
        Perhaps the people without BMI were unable to be weighed? Too unhealthy? Discharged too fast?
