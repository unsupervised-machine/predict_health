Top skills:
    Data Side
    1.  Pandas (my new SQL) for data munging
        this is what I would do in sql, this is how I do it in pandas
    2. Spark/Data Bricks language, open source, 
        Spark is good for big data
        Process big data
        Interface with Py Spark
            Pandas interface
            SQL interface
        Mess around with Scala language.
    3. Get savvy with git
    4. Numpy
        Familiarize yourself with this (base package of R equivalent just need to know how it works)


    Modeling Side:
    1. Sci-kit learn ( data scientist tool chest,)
        Build various models using same data set 
            Random Forest , SVM, Neural Net, etc. (like 10 of them)
    2. XGBoost (state of the art for gradient boosted models)
        Run vanilla XGBoost model
        Run a model on a GPU or a TPU or distributed GPU
    3. Tensor Flow (Worry about these later)
    4. PyTorch (Worry about these later)
